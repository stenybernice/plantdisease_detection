# plantdisease_detection
A cnn based plant disease detection.
This is a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been developed for image classification. 
The solution involves: 
Dataset Collection and Preparation: Gathering a dataset of 87,000 RGB images representing 38 classes, including healthy and diseased crop leaves. The dataset will be pre-processed to standardise size, resolution, and quality. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data characteristics, identifying class balance, and preparing insights for effective modelling. 
Feature Extraction and Model Training: Using CNN layers to extract visual features such as leaf texture and vein structures. Experimentation with different architectures and transfer learning models will enhance performance. 
Model Evaluation and Optimization: Employing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance, identifying gaps, and iterating to improve generalisation.
